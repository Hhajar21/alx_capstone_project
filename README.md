# alx_capstone_project - Personal Portfolio Website

## Project Overview:
The Personal Portfolio Website project aims to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website that showcases the skills, projects, and accomplishments of the developer.

2. **Skills:** A dedicated section lists the developer's skills, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, and more.
3. **Projects:** The website showcases the developer's projects with brief descriptions, images, and links to live demos or source code repositories.
4. **Contact Information:** There's a contact section with contact details or a contact form for visitors to reach out to the developer.
5. **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and look good on various devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.
